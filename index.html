      <h3>What are the benefits of using ReactJS for large projects?</h3>
      <svg width='15' height='10' viewBox='0 0 42 25'>

    <div class='answer'>
    <p>
    The practice greatly benefits large projects with intense user interaction. ReactJS divides the UI into isolated reusable pieces of code known as components. React components work similarly to JavaScript functions as they accept arbitrary inputs called properties or props. Returned React elements determine how the UI will look at the client end.
